# Customers & Products Data Analysis Project
### Overview

This project analyzes a relational database containing Customers, Orders, and Products.
Using PostgreSQL, Python, and Plotly, the goal was to extract valuable business insights, visualize trends, and demonstrate data analysis and dashboard development skills.

The analysis was performed inside a Jupyter Notebook, connecting directly to the database using SQL queries and presenting results through interactive visualizations.

### Key Objectives

✔ Connect PostgreSQL data to Python using SQLAlchemy
✔ Clean, query, and join multiple tables
✔ Analyze customer behavior and sales trends
✔ Create dashboards using Plotly for better insight communication
✔ Apply industrial engineering and data-analytics best practices
