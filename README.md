# Customers & Products Data Analysis Project
### Overview

This project analyzes a relational database containing Customers, Orders, and Products.
Using PostgreSQL, Python, and Plotly, the goal was to extract valuable business insights, visualize trends, and demonstrate data analysis and dashboard development skills.

The analysis was performed by connecting PostgreSQL directly to Python using SQLAlchemy, enabling seamless SQL querying inside the notebook. Pandas was used for data transformation, while Plotly provided interactive visualizations and dashboards to communicate insights clearly and effectively.

### Key Objectives

- Connect PostgreSQL data to Python using SQLAlchemy
- Clean, query, and join multiple relational tables
- Analyze customer behavior and sales performance
- Create interactive dashboards using Plotly
- Apply industrial engineering and data-analytics best practices

### Tools & Technologies

- Database: PostgreSQL, SQL
- Data Analysis: Python, Pandas
- Visualization: Plotly and Dash
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook
- Version Control: Git + GitHub

### Dataset
Relational database tables used:

- Customers
- Orders
- Products
- OrderItem
- SalesPerson

### Analysis Highlights

Some of the insights derived include:

- Total sales analysis by year
- Number of customers per state (distinct values)
- Relationship between orders and customer data through multi-table joins
- Visual breakdown of trends using interactive charts
